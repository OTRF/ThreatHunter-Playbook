    "# LSASS Memory Read Access\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Adversaries might be accessing LSASS and extract credentials from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Context\n",
    "\n",
    "After a user logs on, a variety of credentials are generated and stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process in memory.\n",
    "This is meant to facilitate single sign-on (SSO) ensuring a user is not prompted each time resource access is requested.\n",
    "The credential data may include Kerberos tickets, NTLM password hashes, LM password hashes (if the password is <15 characters, depending on Windows OS version and patch level), and even clear-text passwords (to support WDigest and SSP authentication among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Offensive Tradecraft\n",
    "\n",
    "Adversaries look to get access to the credential data and do it so by finding a way to access the contents of memory of the LSASS process.\n",
    "For example, tools like Mimikatz get credential data by listing all available provider credentials with its SEKURLSA::LogonPasswords module.\n",
    "The module uses a Kernel32 function called OpenProcess to get a handle to lsass to then access LSASS and dump password data for currently logged on (or recently logged on) accounts as well as services running under the context of user credentials.\n",
