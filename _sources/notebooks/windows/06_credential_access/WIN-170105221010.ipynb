    "Adversaries look to get access to the credential data and do it so by finding a way to access the contents of memory of the LSASS process.\n",
    "For example, tools like Mimikatz get credential data by listing all available provider credentials with its SEKURLSA::LogonPasswords module.\n",
    "The module uses a Kernel32 function called OpenProcess to get a handle to lsass to then access LSASS and dump password data for currently logged on (or recently logged on) accounts as well as services running under the context of user credentials.\n",
    "Even though most adversaries might inject into a System process to blend in with most applications accessing LSASS, there are ocassions where adversaries do not elevate to System and use the available administrator rights from the user since that is the minimum requirement to access LSASS."
