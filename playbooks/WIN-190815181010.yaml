hypothesis: Adversaries might be creating new services remotely to execute code and move laterally in my environment
technical_context: 
offensive_tradecraft: |-
    Adversaries may execute a binary, command, or script via a method that interacts with Windows services, such as the Service Control Manager. This can be done by by adversaries creating a new service.
    Adversaries can create services remotely to execute code and move lateraly across the environment.

additional_notes: |-
  * If there are a lot of unique services being created in your environment, try to categorize the data based on the bussiness unit.
  * Identify the source of unique services being created everyday. I have seen Microsoft applications doing this.
  * Stack the values of the service file name associated with the new service.
  * Document what users create new services across your environment on a daily basis
