hypothesis: Adversaries might be leveraging WMI modules to execute WMI tasks bypassing controls monitoring for wmiprvse.exe or wmiapsrv.exe activity
technical_context: |-
  WMI is the Microsoft implementation of the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) and Common Information Model (CIM).
  Both standards aim to provide an industry-agnostic means of collecting and transmitting information related to any managed component in an enterprise. An example of a managed component in WMI would be a running process, registry key, installed service, file information, etc.
  At a high level, Microsoft's implementation of these standards can be summarized as follows > Managed Components Managed components are represented as WMI objects — class instances representing highly structured operating system data. Microsoft provides a wealth of WMI objects that communicate information related to the operating system. E.g. Win32_Process, Win32_Service, AntiVirusProduct, Win32_StartupCommand, etc.
  WMI modules loaded by legit processes such as wmiprvse.exe or wmiapsrv.exe are the following

  C:\Windows\System32\wmiclnt.dll
  C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WmiApRpl.dll
  C:\Windows\System32\wbem\wmiprov.dll
  C:\Windows\System32\wbem\wmiutils.dll

  Adversaries could leverage the WMI modules above to execute WMI tasks bypassing controls looking for wmiprvse.exe or wmiapsrv.exe activity.
