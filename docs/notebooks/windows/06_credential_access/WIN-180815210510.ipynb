This activity is recorded at the source endpoint, from where the replication request is being performed from, via the Microsoft-Windows-RPC ETW provider. Even though the Microsoft-Windows-RPC ETW provider provides great visibility for replication operations at the source endpoint level, it does not have an event tracing session writing events to an .evtx file which does not make it practical to use it at scale yet.\n",
    "* You can collect information from the Microsoft-Windows-RPC ETW provider and filter on RPC Interface GUID E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2 with SilkETW. One example here > https://twitter.com/FuzzySec/status/1127249052175872000\n",
    "* You can correlate security events 4662 and 4624 (Logon Type 3) by their Logon ID on the Domain Controller (DC) that received the replication request. This will tell you where the AD replication request came from. This will also allow you to know if it came from another DC or not."
