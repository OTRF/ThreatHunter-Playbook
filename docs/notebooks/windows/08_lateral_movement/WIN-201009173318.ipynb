    "## Technical Context\n",
    "Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is the Microsoft implementation of Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM), which is an industry initiative to develop a standard technology for accessing management information in an enterprise environment. WMI uses the Common Information Model (CIM) industry standard to represent systems, applications, networks, devices, and other managed components.\n",
    "WMI resides in a shared service host with several other services. To avoid stopping all the services when a provider fails, providers are loaded into a separate host process named \"Wmiprvse.exe\". More than one process with this name can be running.\n",
    "The shared host can run under one of the following system accounts in a Wmiprvse.exe host process:\n",
    "  * LocalSystem\n",
    "  * NetworkService\n",
    "  * LocalService\n",
    "When wmiprvse.exe handles a network connection, it runs under the NETWORK SERVICE account. A Threat actor could try to run code as a Network Service user leveraging the WMI provider host process."

    "## Offensive Tradecraft\n",
    "A threat actor could use a known DLL hijack vulnerability on the execution of wmiprvse.exe to accomplish code execution as a NETWORK SERVICE account. One way to perform a DLL hijack on the WMI provider host is via the wbemcomn DLL.\n",
    "When wmiprvse.exe triggers, it looks for `wbemcomn.dll` in the `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\` directory. That DLL does not exist in that folder. Therefore, a threat actor could easily copy its own DLL in that folder and execute it with the WMI provider host.\n",
    "When the malicious DLL is loaded, there are various approaches to hijacking execution, but most likely a threat actor would want the DLL to act as a proxy to the real DLL to minimize the chances of interrupting normal operations.\n",
    "One way to do this is by cloning the export table from one DLL to another one. One known tool that can help with it is [Koppeling](https://github.com/monoxgas/Koppeling). "
